# capstone3.
## Introduction:
* Thank you for taking the time to read this introduction and for considering my project. I truly appreciate you spending time reviewing my capstone project.
* Unlike my previous capstone projects, which were built entirely with Java, this project showcases additional aspects of software development. It includes working with databases, SQL, JDBC, and Spring Boot, demonstrating how these technologies integrate together in a real-world application.
* Furthermore, I  take responsibility for fixing and enhancing the database and test program to make sure the website works on the progress. Not to mention, others support in creating code, design, and ideas for the website.
* Furthermore, I take responsibility for fixing and improving the database and testing the application to ensure the website functions correctly throughout development.
## The Project 
* In this project, there are several unique and functional components, which are substantial enough to be divided into four parts. 
*      The main Java coding function, 
*      An informative database of products, 
*      Insomnia testing, 
*      Application progress. 
*  The original program ( before fixing - only starter ) :https://github.com/kietnnn/capstoneTest1
